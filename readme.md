## Overview
​
### The challenge

Using HTML and CSS, we were tasked to make our very own profile.
​
### User Story
​
We utilized HTML and CSS elements to enable responsive layouts and UI in our profile page.
​
### Acceptance Criteria
​
-utilizing links
-media queries
-UI scrolls
-images
-Flexbox
​

## My process
I first drafted a sketch of what I wanted my profile to look like. Then I created a wireframe.
Afterwards, I created the backbone of the profile with HTML and added in details using CSS.
​
### Built with
​
- HTML
- CSS
​

​
### What I learned
​
I learned that while there seems to be so much to remember, in coding with HTML and Javascript, every question seems to have an answer in Google. I thought the process would be never ending and dreaded the project a bit just because I felt like I did not have enough knowledge or experience to work on this assignment. However, I am beginning to understand that coding is like building something with leggos. While putting two blocks together seems very insignificant in the process of a 10,000 piece build. However, with a wireframe and resources like the internet as well as instructors, I think the key was persistence!
​
### Continued development
​
I will continuously update my profile.
I am very excited to see how much further I can take this profile as it definitely is just the start.
